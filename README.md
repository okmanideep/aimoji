# AIMOJI

A learning project to create a model to suggest an emoji at a cursor position in a text editor.

Training data format:
```jsonl
{"before": "Do not drink ", "prediction": "â˜•", "after": " after lunch"}
```
But in `.parquet` files

Model inputs, `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embeddings of `before` and `after`.
Model outputs -> one hot or top 3 predictions.

```
Text -> sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 encoder -> logistic regression classifier -> prediction
```

Raw Data chosen for the project is `./data/emojitweets-01-04-2018.txt`. Each line is a cleaned up english tweet with emojis
